This is a template for getting started with Next Js and wallets. It uses next js, solana web3 packages and metaplex. I wanted to make a barebones wallet reader that is a good jumping off point for creating an NFT gated website.

## Getting Started

-npm install

-npm run dev

-localhost:3000
```

OVERVIEW

_app.js
contains all default wallet adapter network code.

Wallet.js
displays/connects to wallet

ListNFTs.js
lists NFTs of connected wallet
